# TEMCO ESP main App CODE

This application establishes a TCP connection between Ethernet and WIFI, and an RS485 connection. The device can be accessed through the standard modbus protocol, so that the value of the sensor on the device can be obtained. A more intuitive way is to scan and read the device through the T3000 software of TEMCO CONTROLS.
